## ⚠⚠⚠ BEFORE RAISING ANY ISSUES ⚠⚠⚠

Without a doubt the most common "issue" raised refers to the following error that people recieve while trying to capture the Autopilot config file.

```
WARNING: Could not load type 'System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256Cng' from assembly 'System.Core, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.
```

Please note, this is NOT an issue, but the way to resolve it is simple - you are missing the msal.ps module in the PowerShell 5.1 & Core module locations. Open up BOTH terminals and install the msal.ps module before attempting to use this tool.

Any issues raised regarding this "error" will be immediately closed moving forward.


## Summary

A module containing tools to assist with the creation of a bootable WinPE USB used to provision devices for enrollment to Intune.


## Pre-Reqs

- [PowerShell 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7)
- [WindowsAutoPilotIntune](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/WindowsAutoPilotIntune) - Installed automatically if missing
- [Microsoft.Graph.Intune](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph.Intune/) - Installed automatically if missing
- [MSAL.PS](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MSAL.PS) - Install this manually for both PowerShell 5.1 AND 7.
- A copy of Windows 10 (Multi-format ISO recommended)

## How to use

Pretty simple one here.. Only one exposed function

``` PowerShell
$params = @{
    winPEPath = "https://githublfs.blob.core.windows.net/storage/WinPE.zip"
    windowsIsoPath = "C:\path\to\win10.iso"
    getAutopilotCfg = $true
    imageIndex = 5 # Optional parameter
    diskNum = 1 # Optional parameter
}
Publish-ImageToUSB @params
```
## What happens

Running the Publish-ImageToUSB function will configure a USB with a copy of WinPE, Windows 10 & the required provisioning scripts.

Once you've configured a USB with the tool, using it as a boot device will launch WinPE and kick off "Invoke-Provision.ps1" to configure Windows 10 on the device and apply the Autopilot configuration file.

Once the provisioning script has completed, removing the USB and rebooting the device will bring us to the Windows 10 OOBE and eventually the Autopilot enrollment screen from the configuration file we captured in the first step.

## What's next?

If time permits, I'm looking to add the following additions to the solution:

- Warnings and the ability to wipe the USB after use - as this solution is VERY volatile, it may be a good idea to trash the USB after being used.
- Allowing custom installation media - currently the solution expects that you will use a Windows 10 ISO to extract the install.wim file. I'd like to allow custom *.wim files to be added during the initial process.

## Caveat Emptor

I'm providing this solution as an educational tool to assist the IT-Pro community with absolutely ZERO warranties or guarantees - I know it works for me, but if it doesn't for you - read the code and fix it..

If you find a problem and want to contribute - please do! I love community involvement and will be as active as my schedule allows.

Lastly, I'm providing a copy of WinPE (which also includes the "Invoke-Provision.ps1" file) on a personal Azure storage account. This will stay up as long as it doesn't begin to cost me too much - if it does, I *will* take it down. If there are better options, please let me know.
